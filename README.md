# AFDM-ISAC
This project is a single-file MATLAB script showcasing Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) with AFDM. The communications chain performs QAM→AFDM modulation and simple equalization with constellation plots. The sensing chain implements time-domain FCCR to produce a 2D Range–Doppler Map (RDM) and a 3D visualization, overlaying ground-truth targets.
